# Dropdown Fix Documentation

## Issue
The user dropdown in the top-right corner was not showing when clicked.

## Root Cause
Bootstrap CSS was included but Bootstrap JavaScript was missing, so `data-bs-toggle="dropdown"` wasn't working.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Bootstrap JavaScript
**File:** `angular.json`
```json
"scripts": [
  "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
]
```

Added to both build and test configurations to ensure Bootstrap's dropdown functionality works.

### 2. Enhanced with Angular Fallback
**File:** `shell.component.ts`
- Added `userDropdownOpen` signal for manual state management
- Added `toggleUserDropdown()` method
- Added `closeUserDropdown()` method
- Added click-outside detection with `@HostListener`

**File:** `shell.component.html`
- Added `(click)="toggleUserDropdown()"` to button
- Added `[class.show]="userDropdownOpen()"` to dropdown menu
- Added `(click)="closeUserDropdown()"` to menu

### 3. Dual Approach Benefits
- **Bootstrap JS**: Native Bootstrap dropdown behavior with proper animations
- **Angular Fallback**: Manual toggle ensures functionality even if Bootstrap JS fails
- **Click Outside**: Closes dropdown when clicking elsewhere on the page
- **Keyboard Support**: Maintains Ctrl+Shift+L logout shortcut

## Testing
1. Click the user name in top-right corner
2. Dropdown should appear with "Sign out" option
3. Clicking outside should close the dropdown
4. Both Bootstrap and Angular methods work together

## Files Modified
1. `/frontend/onedc/angular.json` - Added Bootstrap JS
2. `/frontend/onedc/src/app/layout/shell.component.ts` - Added dropdown state management
3. `/frontend/onedc/src/app/layout/shell.component.html` - Added click handlers and CSS classes

## Result
The dropdown now works reliably with both Bootstrap's native behavior and Angular's state management as backup.
