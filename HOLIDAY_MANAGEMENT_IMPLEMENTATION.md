# Holiday Management System Implementation

## Overview
The Holiday Management System has been successfully implemented with both backend API endpoints and frontend admin interface. This system allows administrators to manage company holidays that will be used for timesheet compliance and leave tracking.

## Backend Implementation

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/holidays` - Retrieve holidays with optional date range and region filters
- `POST /api/holidays` - Create a new holiday
- `PUT /api/holidays/{date}` - Update an existing holiday
- `DELETE /api/holidays/{date}` - Delete a holiday
- `POST /api/holidays/bulk` - Bulk create multiple holidays

### Database Schema
The `Holiday` entity contains:
- `HolidayDate` (DateOnly) - Primary key
- `Name` (string) - Holiday name
- `Region` (string) - Default: "IN" for India

## Frontend Implementation

### Admin Interface
Located at `/admin/holidays`, the Holiday Management component provides:
- Holiday calendar view with year filtering
- Add/Edit/Delete individual holidays
- Bulk import of default holidays
- Search and filter capabilities
- Responsive design with Bootstrap styling

### Features
- Year-based filtering
- Statistics dashboard showing total holidays and next upcoming holiday
- Modal dialogs for creating and editing holidays
- Confirmation dialogs for deletion
- Toast notifications for user feedback

## Default Holiday Data for 2025

The system includes the following default holidays for India:

| # | Date | Day | Holiday Name |
|---|------|-----|--------------|
| 1 | 01-Jan-25 | Wednesday | New Year Day |
| 2 | 14-Jan-25 | Tuesday | Pongal |
| 3 | 15-Jan-25 | Wednesday | Pongal |
| 4 | 31-Mar-25 | Monday | Idul Fitr (Ramzan) |
| 5 | 14-Apr-25 | Monday | Tamil New Year |
| 6 | 01-May-25 | Thursday | May Day |
| 7 | 15-Aug-25 | Friday | Independence Day |
| 8 | 27-Aug-25 | Wednesday | Vinayaga Chaturthi |
| 9 | 01-Oct-25 | Wednesday | Ayutha Pooja |
| 10 | 02-Oct-25 | Thursday | Gandhi Jayanti |
| 11 | 21-Oct-25 | Tuesday | Deepavali |
| 12 | 25-Dec-25 | Thursday | Christmas |

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup
1. The backend includes the new `HolidaysController` with all CRUD operations
2. Database migrations will automatically create the `holiday` table
3. The `ComplianceRepository` has been extended with holiday management methods

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to `/admin/holidays` as an admin user
2. Use the "Add Defaults" button to populate the 2025 holidays
3. Individual holidays can be added, edited, or deleted as needed

### Database Population
To populate the default holidays, use the bulk import feature in the admin interface or make a POST request to `/api/holidays/bulk` with the holiday data.

## Integration with Timesheet System

The holiday system integrates with the existing timesheet compliance system:
- Holidays are excluded from missing timesheet calculations
- The `ComplianceService` already uses holidays to determine working days
- Future enhancements can include holiday validation in timesheet entry

## Security
- All holiday management endpoints require ADMIN role
- Input validation ensures data integrity
- SQL injection protection through Entity Framework

## Files Modified/Created

### Backend Files
- `OneDc.Api/Controllers/HolidaysController.cs` - New API controller
- `OneDc.Repository/Interfaces/IComplianceRepository.cs` - Extended interface
- `OneDc.Repository/Implementation/ComplianceRepository.cs` - Extended implementation

### Frontend Files
- `src/app/core/services/holiday.service.ts` - New holiday service
- `src/app/features/admin/holiday-management/` - New component directory
  - `holiday-management.component.ts` - Component logic
  - `holiday-management.component.html` - Template
  - `holiday-management.component.scss` - Styles
- `src/app/features/admin/routes.ts` - Updated with holiday route
- `src/app/features/admin/admin.component.ts` - Updated with navigation
- `src/app/features/admin/admin.component.html` - Updated template

## Deployment
The system has been successfully built and is ready for deployment:
- Backend published to `/deploy/backend/`
- Frontend built to `/deploy/frontend/`
- Both packages include the holiday management functionality

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the updated backend and frontend to the development server
2. Run database migrations to create the holiday table
3. Use the admin interface to populate the 2025 holidays
4. Test the integration with timesheet compliance features
